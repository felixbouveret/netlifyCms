The bartender asks \"do you all want a beer?\"\n\nThe first one says \"yes\".\n\nThe second one says \"yes\".\n\nThe third one lies on the ground bleeding from his head, because the bar only has two stools and he had assumed there would be three and just sat down without looking and fell on his head. The fact that there are glass shards on the ground everywhere because people regularly drop their glasses to the floor without noticing, and the bartender refuses to do anything about it, doesn't really make things any better."
